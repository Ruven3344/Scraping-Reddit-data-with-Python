# Scraping-Reddit-data-with-R

This project is about extracting posts including their comments from a Subreddit 
using the package PRAW and getting information like author, title, ID and body text

If you only want to extract posts, delete the for-loop which extracts the comments (marked in code)

Data is transoformed in the following way:
Scraped Data -> pandas dataframe -> export in .csv file
