So I started developing a game / simulation, where my students could practice their Python skills in all kinds of environments (mostly robotics, abstract algo & ds problems, and some machine learning / image processing tasks).

Now for the last 18 months I’ve been developing this prototype into a proper game, that's hopefully useful and fun to a larger audience. I'm solo-developing this in my spare time, so it's still very much a work in progress. Please let me know what you think, you can find more details on the game’s Steam page:

128,"2,000 free sign ups available for the ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" online course. (Jan 2023)",AlSweigart,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/101p7xy/2000_free_sign_ups_available_for_the_automate_the/,101p7xy,"UPDATE: The signs up are all used up. (Whoa, that was fast this month.) I'll release new codes on Feb 1st. But you can still see the first 15 of the 50 videos [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F_OgqRuSdI&list=PL0-84-yl1fUnRuXGFe_F7qSH1LEnn9LkW), and the [Previews for all the videos are enabled on the course page](https://udemy.com/course/automate/).

If you want to learn to code, I've released 2,000 free sign ups for my course following my Automate the Boring Stuff with Python book (each has 1,000 sign ups, use the other one if one is sold out): 

~~https:// udemy. com/course/automate/?couponCode=JAN2023FREE~~

~~https:// udemy. com/course/automate/?couponCode=JAN2023FREE2~~

Udemy has changed their promo code and severely limited the number of sign ups I can provide each month, so only sign up if you are reasonably certain you can eventually finish the course. [The first 15 of the course's 50 videos are free on YouTube if you want to preview them.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F_OgqRuSdI&list=PL0-84-yl1fUnRuXGFe_F7qSH1LEnn9LkW)

YOU CAN ALSO WATCH THE VIDEOS WITHOUT SIGNING UP FOR THE COURSE. All of the videos on the course webpage have ""preview"" turned on. Scroll down to find and click ""Expand All Sections"" and then click the preview link. You won't have access to the forums and other materials, but you can watch the videos.

**NOTE: Be sure to BUY the course for $0, and not sign up for Udemy's subscription plan. The subscription plan is free for the first seven days and then they charge you. It's selected by default. If you are on a laptop and can't click the BUY checkbox, try shrinking the browser window. Some have reported it works in mobile view.**

Sometimes it takes an hour or so for the code to become active just after I create it, so if it doesn't work, go ahead and try again a while later.

Some people in India and South Africa get a **""The coupon has exceeded it's maximum possible redemptions""** error message. [Udemy advises that you contact their support if you have difficulty applying coupon codes, so click here to go to the contact form.](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?type=student) If you have a VPN service, try to sign up from a North American or European proxy.

**I'm also working on another Udemy course** that follows my recent book ""Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python"". So far I have [the first 15 of the planned 56 videos done.

Side note: My latest book, Python Programming Exercises Gently Explained is a set of 42 programming exercises for beginners [for free](https://inventwithpython.com/pythongently/) or as a [99 cent ebook](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Programming-Exercises-Gently-Explained-ebook/dp/B0BGYJ7G6T/).


**Frequently Asked Questions:** (*read this before posting questions*)

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)
* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be ""good at math"" to be good at coding.**
* Signing up is the first step. Actually finishing the course is the next. :) [There are several ways to get/stay motivated.](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_how_can_i_get.2Fstay_motivated_to_learn_programming.3F) I suggest getting a ""gym buddy"" to learn with.

Making your code generic so that it can support easy/medium/hard difficulties is great. One suggestion for your code is to precompute things like the number for each square. Computing all the numbers once upfront can be easier that computing them later for each individual square.

Often, minesweeper is used in programming interviews because the square clearing algorithm for those with zero bombs around them requires a depth first search. It can be tricky to get this part right.

Yes, bad or redundant comments are by definition bad, don't do them. but don't throw the _good comments_ out with the bathwater. Good comments are great if you're doing something non trivial (hint: most interesting code isn't just taking the average of a list), when the comments augment rather than restate the code, and for example bring in context that isn't on-screen.

Type annotations and docstrings are of course good too, and usually higher priority. But docstrings are not inline with the code. Absolutely add useful comments when needed and don't be afraid to do so. Especially in a large codebase with a team.

Some of this is redundant or wrong, for example the article says you need to know PEP 8 but then also recommends linters and formatters. If you're using linters and formatters, you don't need to know PEP 8. Please don't memorize PEP 8, btw.

Then it jumps into opinionated stuff, Clean Code in specific is a somewhat controversial book in this day and age. See, ""[It's probably time to stop recommending Clean Code](https://qntm.org/clean)"". Recommending it (and quoting Uncle Bob in general), without several asterisks is a bad plan.

The ""code smells"" are a mix of obvious, controversial, and wrong ideas. 

* Large Fields/Classes/Parameter lists: Self-evident
* Duplicate Code: Complicated, see, ""[Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction](https://twitter.com/BonzoESC/status/442003113910603776?s=20)""
* Data classes: Completely bogus ""all the wrong lessons from 2000s-era Java"" advice

Then it jumps into the weirdly specific implementation decision of dependency injection. Dependency injection is not some universal technique to writing Python.

Finally, the broad, obvious, ""testing is good and use design patterns"" which is coding advice in the same way ""eat food which is good for you"" is nutrition advice.

I'm sure there are more IT specific sites. It seems IT is not as battered there as of now as in US. And they value English as office language. But it may be a bit difficult to interview if in the US currently. 

I'm actually looking to move as well to Poland in a few years. To be closer to family. And better work life balance. Etc. Just came back from there actually.

That said, not to be a downer, but I looked at some US employers, and maybe work in Poland remote. But if they are small (I work at a non profit) they will not do it, the taxes they have to file get too complicated. But the large companies are better positioned if they have a Poland subsidiary.

➕ Plus we added several more to the “long tail” that we hope are useful plus some that we missed [last year](https://tryolabs.com/blog/2021/12/21/top-python-libraries-2021), so [make sure to check out the full post](https://tryolabs.com/blog/2022/12/26/top-python-libraries-2022)!

We are aware that most are around data science & machine learning, but that’s how the ecosystem is moving :)

So:

* What do you think about our picks?
* Did we miss any good ones?

Please let us know! We take feedback seriously to improve the selection every year 💪🏻

Congrats to the individuals and teams behind each of these libraries. We know open source is hard. Thank you for your invaluable contributions to the Python community! 🚀🚀🚀",True

I used both VSCode and Pycharm.
Both have their advantages as well as their downsides.

Pycharm pro has a very nice db-connector integrated as well as a nice color labeled dataframe viewer. The refactoring capabilities is one of it’s greater strengths IMO.
What I dislike about it is the bulkiness of it. It doesn’t run as smooth as the electron based VSCode. On MacOS the three-finger swipe to move cursors to prev or next position is something I used very often.

VSCode is quite lightweight but very extensible.
Sometimes the shortcuts are not as intuitive, but cheatsheets help ^^ (for example cursor to previous position is ctrl - (not as easy as a 3finger swipe).
The various extensions really make VSCode a worthy competitor IMO. 
The biggest strength for me, personally, is the remote container extension which allow you to literally attach to a container. So your fs is visible, you have a terminal inside the container. 

In the end it will be you that has to make the choice, so I’d suggest downloading Pycharm to try it out, but if VSCode is currently doing the job for you, might not be necessary to switch.",False

575,The way I build new FastAPI projects,n1EzeR,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1047tdb/the_way_i_build_new_fastapi_projects/,1047tdb,"Some people were searching my GitHub profile for project examples after reading the article on [FastAPI best practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/wrt7om/fastapi_best_practices).

Unfortunately, I didn't have useful public repositories, only my old proof-of-concept projects. 

Hence, I have decided to fix that and show how I start projects nowadays, after getting some real-world experience. This repo is kind of a template I use when starting up new FastAPI projects:

- production-ready

  - gunicorn with dynamic workers configuration (stolen from @tiangolo)

  - Dockerfile optimized for small size and fast builds with a non-root user

  - JSON logs

  - sentry for deployed envs

- easy local development

  - environment with configured postgres and redis

  - script to lint code with `black`, `autoflake`, `isort` (also stolen from @tiangolo)

  - configured pytest with `async-asgi-testclient`, `pytest-env`, `pytest-asyncio`

  - fully typed to comply with `mypy`

- SQLAlchemy with slightly configured `alembic`

  - async db calls with `asyncpg`

  - set up `sqlalchemy2-stubs`

  - migrations set in easy to sort format (`YYYY-MM-DD_slug`)

- pre-installed JWT authorization

  - short-lived access token

  - long-lived refresh token which is stored in http-only cookies

  - salted password storage with `bcrypt`

- global pydantic model with 

  - `orjson`

  - explicit timezone setting during JSON export

- and some other extras like global exceptions, sqlalchemy keys naming convention, shortcut scripts for alembic, etc.

This also implies moving away from your current approach of using a config singleton that gets referenced wherever you feel like (ex. in your database module, where you set up a singleton for database access). Instead, what you should aim for is to have the app factory that accepts a setting instance and does all relevant configuration in the factory. This will make it easier to dynamically generate settings in Python code, ex. at test time, and make it easier to understand how your application is configured.

I notice that you don't explicitly use any database transactions (at least not in the service layer code for the auth module). I assume this means that the `databases` module is set up to autocommit? Although, [based on the library documentation](https://www.encode.io/databases/tests_and_migrations/) maybe not? 

An approach I've found to work well is to use sqlalchemy's connection and session management. I build a session factory when the application is being created (via the app factory), and then use FastAPI's dependency system to get a session for endpoint that need to access the database. It looks something like--

	@router.post(""/"", response_model=schemas.ThingRecord)
	def create_thing(
	    thing_payload: schemas.ThingCreationPayload,
	    session: db.Session = fastapi.Depends(db.session),
	) -> schemas.ThingRecord:
	    """"""
	    Create a thing
	    """"""
	    thing_record = service.thing.create_thing(session, thing_payload)
	    session.commit()
	    return thing_record

Note that fetching the session and committing the transaction happens in the endpoint code while doing things in the database all happens in the service layer code. This makes it easier to compose operations in the service layer without needing to worry about transaction scope (as one would need to if transactions were handled in the service layer). It is possible to set up the session to commit automatically after the request scope completes, (which would make the code above just `return create_thing(...)`) but I prefer to be explicit.",False

But it only accounts for a subset of functionality that pandas does. Polars forgoes implementing indexes, but indexes are not just some implementation detail of dataframes. They are fundamental to the representation of data in a way where dimensional structure is relevant. Polars is great for cases where you want to work with data in “long” format, which means that we have to solve our problems with relational operations, but that’s not always the most convenient way to work with data. Sometimes you want to use structural/dimensionally aware operations to solve your problems. Let's say you want to take a data frame of the evolution of power plant capacities. Something like this:

    plant  unit       date  capacity
        A     1 2022-01-01        99
        A     1 2022-01-05       150
        A     1 2022-01-07        75
        A     2 2022-01-03        20
        A     2 2022-01-07        30
        B     1 2022-01-02       200
        B     2 2022-01-02       200
        B     2 2022-01-05       250

This tells us what the capacity of the unit at a power plant changed to on a given date. Let's say we want to expand this to a time series. And also get the mean of the capacities over that time series, and backout the mean from the time series per unit. In pandas structural operations, it would look like this:

    timeseries = (
        df.pivot_table(index='date', columns=['plant', 'unit'], value='capacity')
        .reindex(pd.date_range(df.date.min(), df.date.max()))
        .ffill()
    ) 
    mean = timeseries.mean()
    result = timeseries - mean


Off the top of my head I can't do it in polars, but I can do it relationally in pandas as well (which is similar to how you'd do it in polars). Lots of merges (including special as_of merges, and explicit groupbys). I'm sure the polars solution can be expressed more elegantly, but the operations will be similar and it involves a lot more cognitive effort to produce and later decipher.

    timeseries = pd.merge_asof(
        pd.Series(pd.date_range(df.date.min(), df.date.max())).to_frame('date')
            .merge(df[['plant', 'unit']].drop_duplicates(), how='cross'),
        df.sort_values('date'),
        on='date', by=['plant', 'unit']
    )
    mean = timeseries.groupby(['plant', 'unit'])['capacity'].mean().reset_index()
    result = (
        timeseries.merge(mean, on=['plant', 'unit'], suffixes=('', '_mean'))
        .assign(capacity=lambda dfx: dfx.capacity - dfx.capacity_mean)
        .drop('capacity_mean', axis=1)
    )

The way I see pandas is a toolkit that lets you easily convert between these 2 representations of data. You could argue that polars is better than pandas for working with data in long format, and that a library like xarray is better than pandas for working with data in the dimensionally relevant structure, but there is a lot of value in having both paradigms in one library with a unified api/ecosystem.

That said polars is still great, when you want to do relational style operations it blows pandas out of the water.

u/ritchie46 - would you be able to provide a good way to do the above in polars. I could very well be way off base here, and there is just as elegant a solution in polars to achieve something like this.",False

Had a neighbour who'd play music way too loud at all the wrong hours.  It was so ridiculously loud it was just flat out provocation, and interrupted my sleep.

After a while I contacted the landlord and asked her to contact him about it, but it didn't work.  Didn't wanna confront him directly, since having neighbours like that pissed at you can be all sorts of trouble.

One very early morning I woke up to it, again, and decided I'd had enough.  Got out of bed, threw up airodump, filtered devices by signal strength and identified his network, found the client with the most current traffic, and deuathenticated it.

**Poof, everything went quiet** (for a while).  He was streaming music to the stereo via a laptop or something.

Threw together a script with scapy that would wait for a random amount of time, then continuously deauthenticate the laptop for a random period of time, with a delay between the deauths just long enough that the music would abruptly turn on and off.  Then it'd stop, wait a little, and repeat the cycle.  I threw it onto an old laptop I had, bound the script to a hotkey, and placed it at my bedside.  Whenever he'd play too loud, I'd set the script to run for half an hour.

It worked really well, and apparently he got the message.  Just a week later, the blasting had stopped , and ever after he played his music at more civilized audio levels.

Idk how it finds and returns the 50 or if theres an order, but it does. I have it return unique 1000 playlists of the given keyword, then I break each playlist down to it’s songs. I throw every song across all 1000 playlists into a dictionary where the key is the song ID and the value I increment the value of repeated songs if it occurs frequently. Then I return the ~40 most popular songs across all those playlists in a discord message. The result is finding popular songs given a keyword that you can sift through and perhaps find good music that others know of that maybe you don’t. Works on many different keywords.

Noticed a few things about organising the code. You may have already thought of below suggestions, it's just, I want to bring to your attention:

1. Can you separate the core(translation) code base into a package(keep the code base in a separate repository and maintain).
2. Also inside the core package, separate different functionality into modules and keep the common code into utils or something related to it.
3. Keep the Qt app related code into a separate repository. This will install the core package using requirements.txt.

Separating the core code base will allow for extending it or adding layers on top of it. O(Open-Close) in SOLID principle, which is Open for extension and Closed for modification.

mamba is a notable improvement on it. however, it suffers from the same weaknesses in terms of format.

you can just stick to pyenv + venv (or pyenv-virtualenv directly). now pip has properly dependency resolution (EDIT: not true, see comments below) so you don't really need much else. asottile does this a lot.

I am choosing [pdm](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/) instead because I enjoy its features (scripts like npm) and it does not require to activate a venv everytime, or launch a subshell. it has its downsides too. however, it is also forward-looking in the sense that it already offers support for [PEP582](https://peps.python.org/pep-0582/)

I am **not** using poetry. There are several good reasons not to: it refuses to be compatible with certain PEPs (EDIT: see below), plus it mandates upper version constraints which are unnecessary. Here are some references:

The bot can converse in a conversation distinguishing between different people and responding like a friendly discord user. It understands the distinction between being involved in conversation and not being included.

These features only partially work, with the bot easily being able to be taken out of the immersion of being a ""discord user"". However, it was an interesting experiment to test the limits of GPT using the limited functionality we're currently available to. I believe it would definitely be possible to make a very convincing human! Hopefully API for Chat GPT will be released in the near future.

This project wasn't serious and I don't recommend using it. This was a way for me to explore ChatGPT and share my findings! :)

867,Common misconceptions in Python that drove you crazy?,KaptainCapslock,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/zpn4kj/common_misconceptions_in_python_that_drove_you/,zpn4kj,"A few weeks ago a friend asked me for some help with a function which behaved weird and he walked into the classic default mutable arguments misconception, e.g.

    def test(a=[]):
        a.append(""test"")
        print(a)
    test()
    test()

I ran into this problem before and tried to think about other common misconceptions, here are a few I came up with:

str.strip() removes not only the exact prefix / suffix but also all character combinations of the given argument

    ""abxyba"".strip(""ab"")
    > ""xy""
    

The difference between is and ==

    0 is False

    0 == False

```
def test(a=None):

I wouldn't usually recommend one-liners like this as they confuse people, but if you have a lot of arguments with default values that you need to replace its maybe worth it.

For some cases, you can handle the defaults with a simple `or`. This uses or short-circuiting, returning `a` if it is *truthy*, otherwise returning `[]`.

```python
def test(a=None):
    # Use a if it is truthy, otherwise replace with [].
    a = a or []
    a.append(""test"")

Note this is subtly different in that `a` will be assigned `[]` if `a` is *any* *falsey* value, not just `None` -- i.e. `0`, `False`, `None` or `[]`. But often it doesn't matter (your argument is only accepting `list` or `None`).",False

A couple weeks ago I mentioned how I think one benefit of pandas indexes is the ability to designate the primary key/sorting columns of a dataframe and reduce the verbosity of code.

I think this has a really great example of that problem in section 2.4.1 https://kevinheavey.github.io/modern-polars/method_chaining.html

He has this bit of polars code and just count the number of times DepTime appears:

     df_pl
    .drop_nulls(subset=[""DepTime"", ""IATA_CODE_Reporting_Airline""])
    .filter(filter_expr)
    .sort(""DepTime"")
    .groupby_dynamic(
        ""DepTime"",
        every=""1h"",
        by=""IATA_CODE_Reporting_Airline"")
    .agg(pl.col(""Flight_Number_Reporting_Airline"").count())
    .pivot(
        index=""DepTime"",
        columns=""IATA_CODE_Reporting_Airline"",
        values=""Flight_Number_Reporting_Airline"",
    )
    .sort(""DepTime"")
    # fill every missing hour with 0 so the plot looks better
    .upsample(time_column=""DepTime"", every=""1h"")
    .fill_null(0)
    .select([pl.col(""DepTime""), pl.col(pl.UInt32).rolling_sum(24)])

SEVEN!!! Basically every single operation on this dataframe and you have to keep reiterating to polars that: ""This is time-series data, and the temporal element of this series is 'DepTime'""

That's why I suggest some kind of convenience method to establish defaults:

    with pl.DefaultCols(sort_key=""DepTime"", other_keys=""IATA_CODE_Reporting_Airline"") as pl_context:
      # and then all the same code, but not have to mention DepTime/IATA_CODE again
      # just have it automatically included in the right place
      # easier said than done I'm sure but...


----------

And that is basically what I see as one of the principal benefits of the pandas index. Once he calls `set_index` he can do the grouping and rolling and everything without even mentioning `DepTime`

    .set_index(""DepTime"")
    .groupby([""IATA_CODE_Reporting_Airline"", pd.Grouper(freq=""H"")])[""Flight_Number_Reporting_Airline""]
    .count()
    .unstack(0)
    .fillna(0)
    .rolling(24)
    .sum()",False

I really like polars, but one thing I wish it had is indexes. I know the lack of such is one of the reasons that polars can get the performance that it does, but they’re really useful in certain cases, especially multiindexes. I’d actually prefer to do everything in long format, which is what polars encourages, but that’s not practical in many cases as it can result in much larger memory requirements.

There’s also other benefits to multiindexes. For one with long format only all your data manipulations need to be done through relational operations. However if you take advantage of multiindexes you can manipulate your data through dimensional/structural operations, which can be easier to reason about in many cases.

That said I don’t think polars needs to worry about this use case. It’s very good at what it does (better than pandas), but I don’t think it’s a drop in replacement",False

But my analogy breaks apart here because the IDEs can be useful… you just need to know how to program without them, so you know what they’re providing for you vs what other tools are providing.

Even if you already know other languages… IDK, maybe I’d still recommend you be familiar with just writing in a text editor and using the Python shell. That’s how I do 99% of my Python programming, personally, even though I have access to a JetBrains Ultimate account via my work. I use that all the time when I’m working in languages other than Python. But… Python itself is so great, I don’t feel PyCharm really does much for me.",False

This is maybe an unpopular opinion, but all of that information will actually hurt your development as a programmer in the absolute beginning. A major skill you need is to be able to read code and figure out what it does and if it will work. That sort of skill doesn’t come very fast if that information is always handed to you on a platter. 

It’s like trying to memorize where locations are with a GPS whispering sweet nothings into your ear. It’s not like it’s impossible, it just takes longer. Learning syntax and how code flow works and coding without autocomplete will make you feel very comfortable in code very quickly and then all of those tools will make you faster instead of making you reliant on them. 

In my opinion, you should try to avoid using an IDE for the first while of programming. The built in editor (IDLE) that comes with Python will do fine while you learn the basics. Runestone academy has a free Python course (fopp), I believe, with a web based code editor and debugger.

I’m a PhD student developing open source scientific computing applications including machine learning. I’ve coded python in everything from notepad and terminal to pycharm so I’ve gotten to try different things. Here’s my take:

1. I took the edX MITx course on intro to CS which was fantastic. They used the spyder IDE so they thought that IDE would be appropriate for beginners. When I started coding I used it too and felt fine. 

2. There is always a trade off between understand and automating. For instance, notepad is barebones and Pycharm automates a lot. There are different camps of thought ranging from starting with no help and learning the hard way to starting out fully automated and getting a lot of feedback and slowly weaning yourself off depending on that automation (altho you can still choose to use it). 

I really liked Pycharm for software development because of how many features had and how much it automated. But then when I tried to make the code run on other peoples’ computers it wouldn’t work. It took me a while to realize that I didn’t understand several core concepts in python and that pycharm just added the necessary code in its config files, but that wouldn’t work for sharing my code. By switching to VS code I had to learn how to code things correctly. 

You really have to try different text editor and IDE setups to see what you like but just keep in mind it may change over time based on what you need and what libraries you work with. Spyder is included in Anaconda so the data science community is more likely to use it. Pycharm has a ton of features and can be more user friendly to learn how to use than something like VS code where you have to download extensions and there are several options. VS code is very lightweight and flexible. 

Personally, I really like VS code. But I used to not because I wasn’t comfortable figuring out what extensions I needed. Feel free to ask questions. I’m not quite sure what to put down without rambling but I do have more thoughts on the different IDEs.",False

Nah, not really - [you can read the Pandas changelog since 1.1.5](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/v1.1.5.html) to check for yourself :)

Or check out the [Python changelog](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html) (just change the URL to 3.9, 3.10, 3.11.

Biggest change is that Python has become faster, `pattern matching`, better error output (easier to read), Union Operator, included tomllib for parsing toml files.

Note that if you learn a slightly older version of Python (say 3.7, which is from 2018 - pretty ancient) your code will be compatible with 3.11, so no worries there.",False

If you see your future as:

* Writing pipelines for larger datasets and getting the maximum performance out of them, learn polars or spark

A quote from his book kind of gives an outline of the changes for pandas. In 2012-2016, there was rapid development, in 2016-2017 there was the general turmoil due to the transition of Python 2 to Python 3. Since then there have been fewer Python changes but pandas has had enough changes from 2017-2022 to justify him releasing a third version of the book. 

>The first edition of this book was published in 2012, during a time when open source data analysis libraries for Python, especially pandas, were very new and developing rapidly.   
>  
>When the time came to write the second edition in 2016 and 2017, I needed to update the book not only for Python 3.6 (the first edition used Python 2.7) but also for the many changes in pandas that had occurred over the previous five years.   
>  
>Now in 2022, there are fewer Python language changes (we are now at Python 3.10, with 3.11 coming out at the end of 2022), but pandas has continued to evolve.

That being said not too many changes have been made in the last 2 years. If the course you were taking was up to date when it was made it should be relevant with current versions of pandas.

I recently found myself writing more and more inner functions to encapsulate logic easier and make otherwise rather polluting/dead functions stick out less.

I like it, because it allows me to write way cleaner and less bloated code – clustering helper-functions to only where they need to be. Also decreases cognitive load considerably by not having to keep track on where a helper function is being used.

But it has gotten to a point where I'm genuinely concerned, because I have also started defining lambdas in inner-functions too! *I know lambda shouldn't be used and PEP checker complains too, but it's so handy when combined with list comprehensions…*

What are your thoughts on this?   
Do you use nested functions yourself or do you consider it bad practice? Where else do you put helpers?

Look at those type hints. So many options! I get that you’re trying to make things flexible, but all of this variety of types makes things so much harder to follow. People end up passing around strings, users, lists of strings, lists of users and nulls all over the place instead of having one clear place for casting.

If I want to reuse `process_recipients` I can’t. If I want to test it, I can’t. You could rename it to something like `cast_to_emails_list` and have this one reusable “takes anything” function.

Your inner functions are _more_ polluted because they have access to more outer scope variables. You’re more likely to be bitten by typos and other mistakes. 

The keyword only arguments are fine on `send_mail` since that’s so ripe for mistakes. It’s silly on `process_recepients`. The likelihood that someone will mix up the order of positional arguments on a function with one argument is… low. 

Other ways to achieve your goals:

1. Give your functions more descriptive names, as in this name helps me understand what the function does if I didn’t know already. Use a doc string if needed. 
2. Give functions a leading underscore to mark them as a private. But consider if you need to do this. You’re not really making someone’s life easier by giving them less tools that are useful. It’s just if you don’t want it to be something supported outside of the scope of that module.
3. `__all__` is similar.
4. Have one input type for arguments unless the role of the function is casting/deserialization (single responsibility).
5. It’s fine to have some “helpers” module for stuff that isn’t part of the “main story”. A hint that you’re doing it right is you don’t end up with circular imports there.

Your example is a case where I'd use one, but before I got to that I'd really reconsider whether I had built an unnecessarily complicated interface.

The key insight I'd bring to my design is that there's exactly one function that truly needs to exist and behave property, and it looks like this:

```
def send_email(*, subject: str, body: str, to: typing.List[str], cc: typing.Optional[typing.List[str]] ...):
```

Everything is a single type and it's nice and simple to test and verify.

My next step would then be to recognise that I occasionally have cases where conversion to meet this interface is irritating, and in those cases I would build trivial wrappers to handle the scenarios easily. For example maybe I often send email to individual `User`s:

```
def send_email_to_user(*, subject: str, body: str, to: User):
    send_email(subject=subject, body=body, to=to.email)
```

A small collection of specific helpers that do very little additional work are low risk and easy to read and understand.

If I get a proliferation of these, that would be the point where I looked to see if it makes sense to merge some of the helpers into more common interfaces.

This overall approach gives you nice, simple, easily testable interfaces that  are easy to maintain and contribute to the readability of the code that calls them.

Finally I'd like to +1 to another redditor who suggested a `class` for this problem instead. While it depends a little on your code structure, emails are commonly built up over a number of lines of code rather than being a single item. Having the email as a class reduces the number of temporary vars required in the calling code, and also gives more flexibility around template handling and response.",False

        some_code
        block = of + code
        
        for x in blah:
            # this does another thing
            do = things - to(x)
            yet_another(thing)

It's clearer to remove the comments for these chunks of code and instead turn them into inner functions:

    def foo():
        def calculate_block():
            some_code
            return of + code

        def another_thing(x): 
            do = things - to(x)
            yet_another(thing)

        block = calculate_block()
        for x in blah:
            another_thing(x)

The main reason you use inner functions this way is that it helps make the physical structure of the code more closely resembles the actual business logic. The code in the outer function should read like business logic, the inner functions are details for making that business logic to work, e.g. error handling, etc.
            
Using inner functions can give you a better structure to the code without scattering the global scope with functions that **cannot actually be used as a standalone functions** and can't really be understood in its own without the surrounding context. Often these inner functions aren't generic enough to be properly exposed as their own function outside the particular context of the enclosing function, it may break some internal invariants such that it should never be called on their own, and it's not even testable on their own without a very brittle whitebox testing.

The alternative would be to write a class, but classes has their own pros and cons. On one side, classes is more testable. It's not easy to unittest the inner functions of closures. So definitely don't overuse inner functions when classes would've made more sense.

On the other hand, classes doesn't really make conceptual sense when what you have is really just executing a series of procedural steps. Classes are meant for representing objects, if you're creating a class that only has a single public function, or where you always call the functions in the same sequence, then it probably should just be a simple function. 

This is a class overuse anti pattern, you never actually need an instance of ThingProcessor, it's not a real object, just procedural code hidden as OOP:

    class ThingProcessor:
        def process(self):
            self.process1()
            self.process2()
            self.process3()

    def foo():
        thing = ThingProcessor(x, y, z)
        thing.process()
        return thing.result

Similarly, this is also the same anti pattern, only a bit better obscured:

    def foo():
        thing = ThingProcessor(x, y, z) 
        # you always call these functions in this exact order
        thing.process1()
        thing.process2()
        thing.process3()
        return thing.result

You could simplify that into just some simple functions, and just accept that it's actually procedural/functional code:

    def foo(x, y, z):
        def process1(x, y):
            ...
        def process2(z):
            ...
        def process3(a, b):
            ...
        a = process1(x, y)
        b = process2(z)
        return process3(a, b)
    
Most people's knee jerk dislike of your code probably stems from that your particular example is actually a very poor example for this technique. I'd have put that `_process_recipients`, because it's actually a function that would actually makes sense as a standalone function.

Generally I use inner functions to structure functions when there isn't really an easy way to make a clean structure between the inner functions.

The second knee jerk is because there's a lot of people who are only classically trained in OOP, and cannot really think outside OOP's way of doing things, even though Python is a multi paradigm language.",False

# 1. cachetools.LFUCache

Slow insertion times when the cache is full. When the cache is at capacity and a new item is inserted, the cache automatically handles eviction of the least frequently used item. Under the hood, cachetools uses a \`Collections.Counter\` object as it's interface to track item usage frequencies. When an item is evicted, Cachetools calls the \`Counter.most\_common()\` API to retrieve the least frequently used item. This method creates a copy of the original underlying dictionary and sorts it by-key. Python uses \`Timsort\`, which is a O(n\*logn) operation plus copy overhead. When the cache is large, this results in concerningly slow insertion times. With a cache size of 16384, median insertion times are \~0.6 microseconds (1e-6). When the cache is full, P90 and P99 insertion times are 540 and 600 microseconds (1e-6), a \~90,000% and \~100,000% increase from the median, respectively.

To solve this, \`cacheing\` implements an LFUCache API with O(1) insertions, deletions, and gets using a doubly linked list in the backend. This reduced P90 and P99 insertion times by \~45,000% and \~50,000%, respectively.

# 2. cachetools.TTLCache

This is a great time aware cache implementation. The issue is that it exclusively offers a global time-to-live binding for each item in the cache. If you have a use case requiring variable, per-key time-to-lives, this interface will not work for you.

By using a sorted linked list and binary search insertions, the \`cacheing.VTTLCache\` API provides variable, per-key time-to-lives.

Instant NGP is a novel view synthesis framework that reduces the model training for a single scene from hours to a few seconds.

This project is a CUDA-free instant NGP renderer implemented in Taichi, written entirely in Python. Supported by Taichi's built-in GUI system, the project supports real-time rendering and camera interaction while consuming less than 1GB of VRAM. It also contains a fully fused multilayer perceptron (MLP) enabled by the SharedArray feature.

This repo only implemented the rendering part of the NGP but is more simple and has a lesser amount of code compared to the original (Instant-NGP and [tiny-cuda-nn](https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn)).

I do not want to troubleshoot back propagation of changes from inheritance. Sometimes I keep a source frame and break out derivative frames. Two child series or data frames should not permit change propagation from one to the other. Maybe permitting that unsafely is a feature for global updates but its a bad default.

Any time I've passed by reference to what I thought was an operation on a copy it's been a mistake. I understand the memory bonus of returning a view into a data frame for a row or col subset. I know not to assign anything to a row indexed iloc but columnar variable assignment  should present a distinct series from the source data frame. 

For example, I had a column of type numpy.ndarray and I thought by passing to a dataclass generator by using df['col'].values that was effectively scrubbing all pandas properties from the array. When I added +=2 to the dataclass attribute I was surprised to find the source data frame mutated. That was fixed with .values.copy() but this was already using a data frame pass by value copied into the function.

Think about casting from datetime to string in one data frame and it breaking an unrelated function using another variable. That may, in practice, create a copy data frame but my problem is I cannot reason for sure what the default behavior is.

In my opinion, row/index subsets make sense as a mutable view to the source because the index shows gaps. Column subsets would be best served with copy on default.

1306,Starlite development updates January ’23,provinzkraut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/108aq5b/starlite_development_updates_january_23/,108aq5b,"Hello there fellow Pythonistas, do you have a moment to talk about the web framework of choice, [Starlite](https://github.com/starlite-api/starlite)?

In case you're wondering what the heck a Starlite is, here's a quick elevator pitch: Starlite is an ASGI web framework focused on building highly performant APIs quickly and with ease by providing many tools out of the box such as a stellar OpenAPI integration, ORM integration with SQLAlchemy, Piccolo and Tortoise ORM, type safety using rigorous typing, excellent Pydantic support, and many mechanism for customization.

## So what's new?

The first thing I want to highlight was a much requested feature: Starlite now includes a CLI, allowing to quickly run and inspect Starlite applications, featuring a smart autodiscovery that's not restricted by naming conventions.

The CLI is something we are planning to expand on, u/Goldziher for example is currently working on an TypeScript generator that can generate typing files directly from a Starlite app, using the OpenAPI schema!

In other news, Starlite has succumbed to [carcinization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation); Our query string parsing is now done by a dedicated Rust library. Why? Performance. 

As you can see, in [this benchmark](https://imgur.com/a/jlpIx9w) Starlite handily beats even [blakchseep](https://www.neoteroi.dev/blacksheep/), a notoriously fast ASGI framework written in [Cython](https://cython.org/)

If you're coming from [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) and are interested in giving Starlite a try or are looking to migrate, you can now take a look at our all new [Flask migration guide](https://starlite-api.github.io/starlite/1.48/migration/#from-flask), containing examples of common Flask patterns and showcasing their Starlite equivalent.

## A look into the future

Let's talk about what's on the horizon for Starlite!

### Msgspec all the way?

In version `1.45.0`, we introduced [msgspec](https://github.com/jcrist/msgspec) as our serialization backend, replacing [orjson](https://github.com/ijl/orjson). This had some immediate performance benefits, but that's not the main reason we made the switch. 

Msgspec is more than a JSON library; Its distinctive quality is that it combines parsing and schema validation into a single step. Libraries like [Pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic) work by *first* parsing e.g. a JSON string into Python data types, and *then* validate those. Msgspec combines these two steps, which can drastically increase performance. Currently, we make heavy use of Pydantic in Starlite, using it to parse all kinds of things. Headers, query parameters, request data, etc. While this is very convenient, it's not that performant. 

Our goal is to move as much of our internal parsing logic to msgspec as possible, making use of its [`Struct`s](https://jcristharif.com/msgspec/structs.html),while keeping full compatibility with Pydantic. This means that from a users perspective, nothing changes - you can still use Pydantic models and such everywhere you want - but instead of everything being based around a Pydantic model, things don't make use of Pydantic specific features will potentially be a `Struct` instead.

On a side note, you can already use msgspec's [`Struct`s](https://jcristharif.com/msgspec/structs.html) in Starlite for data serialization today!

### (Re)write the docs

This may sound like a huge undertaking, and that's because it is, but personally, I believe that good documentation is one of the most important things for any library. The best tool isn't worth anything if no one can figure out how to use it. For a while now we've been making incremental changes to the docs, mostly expanding examples and making them self-contained and executable, rewording section, adding graphs here and there, but the most fundamental changes still lay ahead.

#### Goodbye mkdocs, hello Sphinx

The second biggest one will be moving away from [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and to [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). During the process of the documentation overhaul, it has become clear that, while a great tool, *mkdocs* simply is not fit for the purpose of providing well structured, larger scale documentation. It definitely has its merits, and I would absolutely recommend it for someone looking for a simple tool to write not to complex docs, but if it's going to be more involved, mkdocs' shortcomings will catch up with you at some point.

So what are the issues with mkdocs?

It basically boils down to three things:

**1. Markdown and its extensions.** 

While markdown itself is a nice and convenient tool, it's missing most of the features needed for technical documentation, which is why documentations built with mkdocs (and mkdocs-material in particular) rely on a whole host of markdown extensions, most of which introduce extra syntax, or mini-DSLs. While this can be an easy and quick fix, it's also very brittle. The more documents you have, the more issues you're running into, such as overly lenient parsing resulting in partly broken documents and having to employ several linters to keep everything somewhat sane.

With Sphinx/ReST, almost no extensions are needed, since it was developed with the express purpose of writing technical documentation. ReST is a turn off for many people, and I agree that it's not as straightforward as markdown, and it definitely has it's quirks, but once you add all the extra syntax required to make markdown work for technical documentation, I'd argue ReST is actually the simpler one, mainly because it was built with extendability in mind (via its directives) so where markdown extensions will add new Syntax, in Sphinx this can be solved by 
adding a new directive.

**2. API documentation**

Mkdocs has the [mkdocstrings](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/mkdocstrings) plugin, offering limited automated API documentation capabilities. It is however nowhere near as capable as Sphinx' [autodoc](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html), missing granularity in its configuration, limited [intersphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/intersphinx.html)-like cross-referencing support, and essential features like documentation of inherited members, or the ability to manually describe objects if needed.

**3. Structure**

While mkdocs allows you some degree flexibility on how to structure your documentation, it's still rather restrictive. For example the ability to define a toc-tree for every document you create, without having to resort to some global configuration is invaluable when structuring more complex documentations.


**Is mkdocs really this bad?**

As you might have noticed, I am a Sphinx proponent, but I wanted to note here that I am not trying to diminish what mkdocs has accomplished. It is a fantastic tool, especially when it comes to ease of use and it has a significantly more attractive learning curve than Sphinx. I have actually spoken out against such a move to Sphinx in the past, but since come to the conclusion that the benefits of Sphinx outweigh the cost of the migration.

#### Breaking it down

Currently, our documentation is rather loosely structured. We have a reference section, a usage guide and a migration guide. The usage guide is basically a catch all for different types of documentation: Tutorials, how-to guides, technical background sections. This makes it harder to navigate, and it also doesn't take into account the different audiences consuming it. To solve this, we are going to break these topics down into their own separate sections in the documentation, making it easier to navigate, locate, and provide content that's better suited for individual target groups.

Some of the current content will be re-used, but a lot of it will have to be written from scratch, so it's going to be somewhat of a big undertaking, and it will take a while.

Not all of this will happen at once, it will be a gradual process, and there's no deadline for this. But changes are coming, and I am very excited about them!

### Starlite 2.0

After talking about the documentation for so long, this feels almost like a side note but: We have started to plan Starlite 2.0. It's (probably) not going to be a drastic change compared to Starlite 1.x, but more a set of changes allowing us to get rid of some outdated or superseded APIs, do some refactoring, improve usability of existing features and general code-housekeeping. Maybe bigger changes will come, but as of now, there are no concrete plans in that regard.

Pandas is:
 - single-threaded
 - extremely slow
 - consumes a lot of memory 
 - has huge memory consumption spikes for some operations like joins
 - doesn’t have lazy operations 
 - has weird type conversions, can literally break your types, the Int64 vs int64 is a pita 
 - API is often non-pythonic 
 - complex pandas code is an unreadable mess

Polars is the opposite for every item in this list.

- I can’t see a reason to separate your two scraper scripts. You should figure out a way to combine them because they perform a very similar function… so similar that they should certainly be in the same class.

- I can’t really read all your code right now because I’m on mobile, but are you running this on a CRON job, or some sort of scheduler? After I got my scraper working I spent a while learning how to properly schedule it, save it to a database, etc… ended up having to write more python to deduplicate new records and only save diffs from different scrapes. 

- How are you planning on scaling it up? You’ve done a good job abstracting parts of your scraper, but I imagine you have a bit more work to do to apply it to other sites. It’s really hard to generalize these methods to be used on different websites, but you should try to be able to pass a website name as a parameter inside that class somewhere.

 - ^ this is because it’s really easy to break a scraper. A small change to a website often forces you to rewrite logic, and if you’re scraping 4 different sites, maintaining 4 different scripts is a huge pain.

1356,"trinary: a Python project for three-valued logic. It introduces Unknown, which you can use with the regular True and False. It's equivalent to K3 logic or using NULL in SQL. I made it over the last few days and have open sourced it on GitHub in case someone needs the same thing. Feedback welcome!",TravisJungroth,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/zudwr6/trinary_a_python_project_for_threevalued_logic_it/,zudwr6,"[trinary on GitHub](https://github.com/travisjungroth/trinary)

[tinary on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/trinary/)

To save you a click, here's some of the [readme](https://github.com/travisjungroth/trinary#readme).

### Usage
To use trinary, import `Unknown` into your Python project. You can then use `Unknown` alongside `True` and `False`.

    from trinary import Unknown
    
    # Logical AND
    print(Unknown & True)      # Unknown
    print(Unknown & False)     # False
    print(Unknown & Unknown)   # Unknown


To cast to a `bool`, use strictly or weakly to decide how `Unknown` is cast. Here's a larger example.

    from trinary import Trinary, Unknown, strictly, weakly

    test_a = Unknown
    test_b = True

    passed_both = test_a & test_b
    print(passed_both)            # Unknown
    print(strictly(passed_both))  # False
    passed_at_least_one = test_a | test_b
    print(passed_at_least_one)    # True
    maybe_failed_both = weakly(~test_a & ~test_b)
    print(maybe_failed_both)      # True

\--Intro

In the past 2 years I've spent some time on and off working on what I view as an alternative to an application like Mint. When I started on it the main feature I was hoping to include was spending and budget tracking. It has since grown slightly with some balance and investment tracking. It is still very very basic but I've gotten to the point where it feels like the basic infrastructure is in place to add on a lot of functionality

\-- Program Description

First of all, the whole thing is written in Python. The ""backend"" is an SQL database. The GUI is tkinter.

Recently, the part I've really worked on is loading in transactions from .csv data and applying some automatic categorization to them as well as the option for the user to manually categorize transactions.

I'm looking for someone who's motivated about this project and would like to help add features and make it more stable and usable.

DM me to get a link to the Github (my personal info is on the Github so I don't want to post it here). I'm looking for people to either

a) collaborate working on it casually or

b) actually try to start using it -programming experience would be required... there's still bugs :)

Because you’re experienced with extending numpy functionality with rust, I was wondering if you might be able to point me in the right direction for a project I’m working on. Don’t feel obligated to respond as it’s a bit open-ended, but if you have a minute it would be a great help.

I’m building an in-house tool for our computer vision modeling team to inspect performance. Our most important metric is Intersection over Union (IoU) - the area (in pixels) where the predicted mask overlaps the ground truth mask divided by the area covered by either of the two. Basically, the highest possible IOU is 1, which means the proverbial Venn diagram is just a circle.

I’ve been trying for months to speed up my IOU calculations enough to allow a dataset with about ~5000 images (on average about 100 labels per image, 33 different label classes) to be sorted by IOU in realish time. Ten seconds or less would be fine.

My first approach used a df to store each mask polygon as a shapely object, then sorted a list of images by querying the df with Boolean indexing. This took about 15 minutes.

My second approach involved rasterizing the polygons on a 2d boolean numpy array and using np.logical_and/or to vectorize the iou calculations. I need to do it in chunks because the Boolean numpy arrays are enormous. This takes about 5 minutes.

What would be really fast (I think) is using some sort of sparse array that would allow me to vectorize the entire dataset at once in memory, but I haven’t found any libraries with sparse arrays that support these operations.

I guess my ultimate question is this: is this a good excuse for me to finally start learning rust? If not, do you possibly have any other suggestions?

These result were linked in other threads before and discussed extensively.

> Most of the thread ended up being discussion of binary extensions

Because the conda people showed up, and they care about that.

> I consider that the PyPA must be destroyed

The PyPA are just volunteers that try to cooperate. Most of the PyPA tools don't share the same maintainers. (setuptools and twine share one out of five. setuptools and pip share one out of eight. pip and flit share one out of nine. wheel, pipenv, hatch share none.)

venv is not even a PyPA tool.

> I don’t think I’ve seen a single comment from the people behind Poetry or PDM

And that's the fault of PyPA?

> But do the maintainers of Poetry or PDM agree?

Hard to say if they don't care to join the discussion. They are just as responsible for creating too many tools, that don't solve all problems imaginable.
> that’s at least 12 too many

So, how should all those people that use the wrong tool be forced to use pip and venv?

cargo doesn't (have to) solve any of the binary problems being discussed.

I believe the authorities need to activly come with a strong standard that covers most use cases (instead of a new tool). Then, hopefully the existing tools will start to suport said standard and one will probably end up on top, or at least the different tools will behave similarly.

In today's age, dependency management is the single biggest thing a language needs to get right. Having multiple competing tools just leads to confusion. People don't want a standard, they want to know what actual tool they should be using.

The same applies to linting and other code quality tooling. There are too many options, and none of them have autofix capabilities. Hell, we even have multiple relevant type checkers and autoformatters!

Meanwhile Javascript has one type checker (typescript), one linter (eslint), one autoformatter (prettier), and while it does have multiple package management tools, the default of npm is perfectly serviceable for most people.

The PyPA and PyCQA need to pull their heads out of their arses, and centralise around one tool that does the job really well.

I have been working on a new framework called Starfyre ([https://github.com/sansyrox/starfyre](https://github.com/sansyrox/starfyre)) that allows you to write reactive frontend apps in Python. It's based on Pyodide and WASM, and aims to reduce the need to write JavaScript for front-end development.

Right now, Starfyre is in the early stages, but the example showcases several features, including a:  


\- JSX-like language  
\- adding children to parent components  
\- component syntax  
\- component state   
\- global state  
\- and the overall project architecture.   


The project was initially considered a companion to my other project - [Robyn](https://github.com/sansyrox/robyn) , but , I am a big fan of client-server architecture, and I believe that having a project like Starfyre would be beneficial for everyone.

The API will likely change in the future, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. Feedback is greatly appreciated! 😊

I have used Smarty(PHP), Freemarker(JSP/JAVA), DjangoTemplates & Angular(1.x)JS templates. JSX blows them all out as templating engine.

Your hard work needs to gain currency(adoption) for the project continue, evolve and keep you engaged and hopefully get paid & recognized for the efforts.

Like Armin Ronacher creator of Flask created JINJA in a way that it works as standalone templating Engine. And it works with other frameworks and is used with Django and even with FastApi. Someone who has used JINJA is more likely to even use/switch to Flask for a next project.

I fear being JSX-""**like""** might not be good enough. It will be great if what developers have write **is** JSX (your project perhaps could/should transform it into a JSX-like or more pythonic form). Yes, it will need additional transformation. But, with this developers could have one common JSX mental model for writing Front-end i.e. generating HTML.

In all likelihood, many of these popular projects have already dropped support for Python 2 for a long time, it's just that someone needs to do the cleanup task to remove the extant Python 2-isms. Long time maintainers usually have more impactful things to work on, in addition to reviewing other people's contributions, and code cleanup usually isn't a very exciting task for occasional contributors either, who mostly want to work on a specific bug that they're currently encountering. 

Just the slog of cleaning up Python 2-ism isn't very rewarding, and it can potentially introduce subtle bugs. And for maintainers, reviewing cleanup is not easy either.

These are Python bindings for the amazing terminal image visualizer [Chafa](https://github.com/hpjansson/chafa).

## What does it do?

Well, Take for example, this [image of a snake](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuardKenzie/chafa.py/main/examples/snake.jpg). With a few lines of Python, it is rendered to:

https://preview.redd.it/2av1zu75q0ba1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f9d050436f1a7e8e647d8fdca08171462e6d65dc

It takes image data and converts it to graphics formats (kitty/sixels) or ANSI/Unicode characters suitable for display in your favorite terminal emulator.

in reality, the first few lines of the image is just the following characters:

    ▂▂▃▃▀▅▁▃▀▅▆▆▆▁▃▃▀▘╴▝▖▃▃▀▆▆▆━▂▃▀▅━▀▂▂┷▆▆▅

along with some terminal escape sequences to set the background and foreground colors. This image was rendered with the few lines of code I have included at the end of this post.

## Where can you get it?

Check out the [installation](https://chafapy.mage.black/usage/installation.html) page in the docs for full, up-to-date instructions. Basically, this is what's up:

**Chafa.py depends on**

* [Chafa](https://hpjansson.org/chafa/download/)
* [MagickWand](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) if you want to use the included Loader class to load images.
* Python 3.5 or newer

Chafa.py is available on PyPi and can be installed with

    pip install chafa.py

Hey coders, created a quick post the other day that got popular talking about Plotly Dash as being the best full-stack framework for python web/app developers, addicted to that karma I figured I'd try and build off the conversation I had started.

[Interactive Real-Life Mini-Map Example \(Admin Dashboard\)](https://preview.redd.it/1niwvo8j1g6a1.png?width=3318&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cf9766cc09e281f61af6e021affdeab351608a5f)

Suppose this is a more in-depth explanation addressing some of the popular comments people had and a more thoughtful explanation of my thoughts from someone who has spent a lot of time building within the framework and as I attempt to offer some useful tips and resources I've found along the way.

Looking for a quick idea of what is possible with this development stack:

Django Dash

[http://ukrainemapwar.com/](http://ukrainemapwar.com/)

Flask Dash

[http://www.pipinstallpython.com/](http://www.pipinstallpython.com/)

GitHub Organization & future tutorials focused on both of these projects:

[https://github.com/Pip-Install-Pirate](https://github.com/Pip-Install-Pirate)

[Mobile Development Should Be the Priority](https://preview.redd.it/k206elyx1g6a1.png?width=1696&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c25e6e02836622db6e9bc6562997be3321332b04)

I've included both of these applications in this article as they are very similar in outside design but drastically different when considering speed, capabilities, and mobile development.

# Perks & downsides of Django Dash

Well, it's the most popular framework for python. Add a Postgres database and a few query sets to your application and you have a powerhouse of dashboards for your data. I've established a popular tutorial on the subject @ \~80k views on how to get it set up for those interested: [https://youtu.be/psvU4zwO3Ao](https://youtu.be/psvU4zwO3Ao) Now for the downside.. slow to load content and limited with dash abilities & @.callbacks. My (workaround) is instead of just creating and hosting your dash applications directly on your site. Consider creating a proper API on Django to house your database and route the information into a flask application via a request to create a better structure for speed, keeping stuff into separately ran contained applications will drastically improve performance and offer more compatibility for mobile developers.

# Perks & downsides of Flask Dash

Flask is amazing but then again.. no batteries included. This means you have to do everything from scratch, user authentication, \*optional database, routing, and no out-of-the-box admin portal.. however, my (workaround) has been to either ignore these complex integrations or alternatively create a Django application as the parent and use my flask application as children in relation to their dependence. Building a soft-connected V.S. a **pip install django-plotly-dash** which I'd consider a hard-connection relationship between Django & Flask. As mentioned above with an API you'd get drastic improvements by designing a soft-connected solution operating via requests.

# Mobile > Desktop

From my analytics, 70% of all traffic is from phones. When designing any application from Flask, Dash, or Django make sure you keep this in mind as for most building it to be mobile first is the priority over anything else. Something I'm actively working on redefining. A quick tip is from host='' to allowed\_hosts=\[''\], in any application you develop in testing you can add your Ip Address in the host='Ip.Address.Number' to the allowed\_hosts=\['Ip.Address.Number'\] that is supported with your framework of choice and you'll be able to pull your test application up on your personal phone or devices that are connected to the same wifi the computer that's being used to develop the project is located.

# Keep the code Mr. Clean

Outside of this, it is important to create clean code and documentation, some of the obvious ways of achieving this is pushing projects to an organized GitHub account or organization. I've also found  [https://pypi.org/project/colorama/](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) very useful as printing your outputs in color can save you a lot of time and headaches. Lastly don't underestimate sectioning code into classes, functions, pages, templates, and any other practical sense.

[Live Code Editor in App with @.callbacks](https://preview.redd.it/unslyx3wjg6a1.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7a3b19376e49dea42f1a56bdde4bf7bd311df1a7)

# Understanding Just Dash

Obvious stuff so far, now let's dive into the more complex. Dash is a framework that allows developers the ability to solely code in python and the framework sends the functions created thru .json that speaks to react.js and displays the content for an interactive application. This is partly why a soft connection as mentioned above is the ideal solution as there are  @.callbacks that are provided within the dash framework that allows developers to assign ids to their components that will act as a state, input, or output depending on what your needs are. To get the full features of Dash you need to understand it was built for Flask first and foremost.  However, you might find that some of the features of Django are too enticing to pass up on not including it within your development stack.

One of the major misunderstandings I've found when talking to people new to the framework is the idea that dash should only be used for single-page applications. This is far from the truth, in the tutorial above we build a quick multi-paged application in less than 15min of coding. Any developer interested in skipping the jargon can set it up in 2min with a simple:

    git clone https://github.com/pip-install-python/pipDash-Basics.git
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python app.py

My goal with this simplistic dash app is to showcase a solid foundation that includes a requirements.txt that showcases some useful packages that are better understood by reading the GitHub's [README.md](https://README.md): [https://github.com/pip-install-python/pipDash-Basics#readme](https://github.com/pip-install-python/pipDash-Basics#readme)

Sence Dash==2.5, Multi-Page integration has been a simple thing to get set up when designing in the framework. The main idea is you have a base [app.py](https://app.py) file that has to declare it's an app with:

    app = Dash(__name__,
             external_stylesheets=[
                 'https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v6.2.1/css/all.css',
             ],
             external_scripts=[
                 ],
             use_pages=True,
             assets_url_path='assets',)

All you do is add the **use\_pages=True** and within your project's root directory add a folder named pages. In this folder, you create whatever [page.py](https://page.py) you intend on building out and after your imports, you add:

    dash.register_page(__name__)

That's it! Alongside this, you can create an assets folder within your root directory that is referenced in the above [app.py](https://app.py) and you'll be able to add custom static assets to your project. (keep in mind name casing matters with pages & assets folders)

Useful references to expand on this specific aspect are:

[https://dash.plotly.com/urls](https://dash.plotly.com/urls)

[https://github.com/AnnMarieW/dash-multi-page-app-demos](https://github.com/AnnMarieW/dash-multi-page-app-demos)

From this point, you have an application capable of compartmentalizing individual pages. The next step is to fill these pages with useful information. Every page automatically renders to the [app.py](https://app.py) file via a declared variable called layout an example of a simplistic layout with @.callback functionality:

    layout = html.Div(children=[
         html.H1(children='This is our Analytics page'),
         html.Div([
             ""Select a city: "",
         dcc.RadioItems(['New York City', 'Montreal','San Francisco'],
             'Montreal',
         id='analytics-input')
         ]),
         html.Br(),
         html.Div(id='analytics-output'),
    ])
    
    @dash.callback(
    Output(component_id='analytics-output', component_property='children'), Input(component_id='analytics-input', component_property='value') ) 
    def update_city_selected(input_value): 
    return f'You selected: {input_value}'

The important thing to note is most of the components you work with in-dash offer the availability for multiple components to be nested within each other. Once given enough time you'll understand that dash is mostly the language of HTML. The html.Div() is a great example of how these nested components work as you'll find yourself needing multiple components in the same div, the way to achieve nested components is simply adding a list within the function creating the component. Above this is labeled with the children=\[component1, component2, component3...\], which should be an easy enough concept to understand.

Before I finish this written tutorial I'd like to offer you the \~4 most useful packages I've found offering clean components for dash design. (pls lmk of any other projects)

The Python interpreter knows where (on your filesystem) it is, and uses that to figure out the locations of those other files.

A venv is literally just a copy of that directory structure, containing a copy of the Python interpreter (as a link/shortcut to the real original one, so it doesn't take up tons of space) and its own separate `bin/` and `lib/` directories. When you ""activate"" a venv, all you're doing is temporarily setting some environment variables to say ""when I type `python` or `pip` or other commands, look for them in the venv's directories"".

https://reddit.com/link/zpiow6/video/w3mya9irfs6a1/player

In this article we show how localization can be used to search ***within*** an image e.g searching specifically for a ""bear paw"" within the image of a whole bear, or a ""Broccoli"" within a plate of vegetables.

To do this, we leveraged Marqo + yolox (Marqo-YOLO), CLIP and OWL-ViT.

Adding the extra dimension of localization can improve retrieval performance and enable new use cases for image search while also helping with explainability.

For localisation at search time we ended up using OWL-ViT. This worked really well. We did not try Detic or CLIPseg but would be interested to hear if anyone else has tried these?

AWS Lambda is one of many ways to deploy code on AWS.

* AWS Lambda
* ECS
* EC2
* EKS
* etc...

You can deploy almost any type of code on all of these including a python API.

What makes AWS Lambda special is:

* You can deploy docker containers, or .zip files. [LINK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html)
* It is 100% ""serverless"", AKA AWS manages the server for you, and you just tell AWS how many instances you want to run.
   * This is done with Firecracker [LINK](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/firecracker-lightweight-virtualization-for-serverless-computing/)
* It can scale from 0-10,000+ instances really quickly
* It can be very cheap vs a EC2 instance if you have a bursty load
* You can string together multiple Lambda functions using AWS Step Functions [LINK](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/)
* You can trigger the lambda functions with a wide range of things. [LINK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-invocation.html)
* You can run numerous functions in parallel.
* Stateless (ish, you can have state, but don't do that)
   * This is both positive and negative. Most modern code should be stateless. IE, you should be able to kill it at any point, and run it again. The state should be stored in a database, not locally with the code.

AWS Lambda has some downsides:

* It can be expensive if you have a constant load
   * Data processing, 5+ minute loads, etc.
   * Most light/fast APIs will be much cheaper on Lambda than a tradition ECS + EC2 setup. 
* Testing locally is annoying [LINK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-using-debugging.html)
* Lambda does some weird things with requests.
   * You need to add some middleware to handle it. [LINK](https://pypi.org/project/mangum/)
* Cold starts!
   * If you haven't called your Lambda in \~15 minutes, the next call can take much longer to start. [LINK](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/operating-lambda-performance-optimization-part-1/)
* You don't have control, so if something goes wrong with AWS Lambda, you can't do anything about it.
* 15 minute max
   * You can only keep a lambda up for a max of 15 minutes. For an API this is more than enough, but for a larger job you should look somewhere else (ECS Fargate, AWS Batch)
* Other limits (CPU, Time, RAM, etc.) [LINK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html)

&#x200B;

Other, more “traditional” ways to deploy a web API would be AWS ECS or AWS EC2.

ECS offers something called Fargate. It is built on the same serverless framework (Firecracker) and will let you deploy code without dealing with the underlying hardware. This has a lot of the same advantages as AWS Lambda without most of the disadvantages.

&#x200B;

Now to the question I suspect you are really asking.

""When should I use a Web API vs another processing method like a queue consumer, map reduce job, ETL pipeline, batch job, etc?""

That is a very hard question to answer, and it depends on exactly what you are trying to do. Based on your post history, I assume you are trying to move a monolithic ERP system to microservices?

It essentially runs code such that you do not have to manage the compute (by either setting up a server or a docker environment). However, it can be integrated with AWS API Gateway, which handles some of the features of a web framework with respect to rest APIs in a language independent manner.

For example, instead of using FastAPI in your code to define a path, method and parameters for a function (router), you define an endpoint in API gateway and optionally attach input models to it. You also define a target (which can be a Python Lambda, JS Lambda, an ECS container, etc.). API gateway can be configured to handle authentication, throttling and other features of a reverse proxy as well.

On a request API Gateway will handle the input, and pass to the execution environment. The input is presented as a dictionary to the ""handler"" function, your code runs and returns a dictionary for output that matches your output model (or raise an exception). API Gateway is then responsible for marshalling the output into a HTTP response.

I have several apps in production that were developed on Django or Flask, and deployed to Lambda using [Zappa](https://github.com/zappa/Zappa).

- local development is easy and can follow the default framework's workflow
- deployment is trivial through Zappa
- all the advantages of Lambda (cost, scalability etc.)
- you can deploy the thing to anywhere else if you need to later on with minimal changes, if any

## Disadvantages

- whatever disadvantages Lambda usually has
- if you have complex setup needs, it can require some digging in Zappa to integrate them into the deployment process
- cold starts times two; depending on what your framework does during startup, that'll add to Lambda's inherent cold start times

I haven't found the cold start times to be an issue in practice; it can take several seconds, yes, but unless you have hard requirements for millisecond responsiveness, that's not very noticeable in an average web app. You can also compensate with keeping instances warm and/or using reserved instances.",False

In saying that, project size would matter. 
We had pretty low traffic (< 1000 users), and it would have been infrequent requests ( unlike social media which relies on your user coming back more and more).

Yes you can deploy a framework app as a lambda. No you dont want to.

Each lambda should be simple and single purposed behind an api gateway endpoint.

You keep the code small and simple and fast. If you add a framework to this your adding extra code for little reason.  Libraries yes framework no.  Most api endpoints are a form of crud create, read, update, delete which gets implemented as some form of read event, transform write, return value. This can be achieved in pure code no libraries required. Because you have api gateway you dont need to be a webserver nor handle http. You wont have caching as your a ephemeral runner.i.e. your lambda is running 10minutes at a time at most and should be expected to be fresh for each request most of the time.  As its ephemeral you need it to run quick and end.

For example use databases which dont have persistent connections.  Use sqs and sns to decouple long running processes from the user requests.

 But i would look at something like serverless framework for making a single codebase from multiple lambdas as its a framework around deployment not the code being run.


Now the question being asked:
Lambda can be cheaper and has no standing costs just traffic costs.  A serverless system scales with traffic so happier customers. 

  But if you need a sql database or use services which are slow to setup it can be worth having a server. Or if you need to limit consecutive connections. I.e. db connection pooling.",False

1. For very low traffic application. If your application sits mostly idle, then lambda is going to be cheaper since you're only paying for whenever there is a request.

2. IMO, the most useful use case for Lambda is to write an Edge function (using Lambda@Edge) this is a class of application that is not really possible to build using traditional web stack. 

3. For applications which, for every time the function run, you get paid enough money to cover scaling to infinity and it absolutely cannot go down. If you're writing an application that doesn't cover its own cost, you really don't want infinite scalability. You want to set a predictable budget and the site can just go down once it exceeds that budget.

Use traditional web applications:

1. When you need consistently low latency. It is possible to manage cold starts in Lambda, but this is much easier to manage with traditional application

2. When you want to have a predictable costs. Lambda billing surprise is a thing, don't get into one

3. When you have a large application that is dealing with a predictable amount of load/traffic, it's usually cheaper to go with a fixed infrastructure.

4. For applications that needs to do actual computation the takes time. Lambda has a short time limit, if you need to exceed that limit, then use traditional infrastructure. 

5. If you can't stand being vendor locked to AWS ecosystem, then don't use Lambda. 

If you just want auto scaling, you don't necessarily have to use Lambda. EKS or ECS can be an option too. They can be slightly more complex to maintain, but they also give you much more finer grained control than Lambda.

This is likely to be very brittle since any code change on their end will break your script, this is more of an r/Outside problem, as one other comment said, just place a recurring order.

EDIT:

You may not need selenium for this. It may just be a post request but then you get into XSS/CSRF/CORS etc issues. Dig into it though, may be ways to do this easily.

What will you be running thes scripts on?

**A local PC**    
What if it breaks? Make sure you have monitoring in place to keep it running... See r/SysAdmin or google devops...

Which one? Again devops or r/SysAdmin

In essence if you are going to be running your business off this keep in mind it becomes critical infrastructure.

It did among other stuff basically all the paperwork for me. 
-price offers , automated the price calculation. I threw in hours amounts, materials etc..  if it's something I had done before, tells me what to be careful for (if I had made a note). Then it sends to the customer by email. Python(pandas) to excel to pdf. 
-delivery documents and invoice based on the price offer. Same thing python excel pdf mail with one input. 
-end of each month a nice spreadsheet for the accountant. It connected to my bank via their api so if something was off(valued not corresponding or missing)  I got alerts.  
-watch bank , compare invoices, if customer not paying, automate the mail spamming asking for payment.
-get stats on activity ( finances, inventory etc...) 
-get stats on each case. That way if I have to do the same thing again (same part) it told me how much it costed last time,  how much I estimated and for how much i got it wrong so next price can be accurate.  
Some other stuff like online regular buys, etc...
In the end I ended up enjoying much more making this thing than actually running the company. Got bankrupt,  and now trying to enter in the python dev game but in my country getting a job without the diploma is tough so I'm getting a day job and I'm working on a big project aside to show to future potential employers.

I used to manage business processes at a manufacturing company and when I came in I inherited a homebrew Enterprise Resource Planning software. This company was built from the ground up so the guy who wrote the software wrote it over time while growing the company. It worked great until more people needed to get involved. Now significant time had to be spent teaching others this product. What the owners didn’t know was that the other software they were connecting to did all of this for them. 

For example, automatic reordering: They did everything in this “ERP” for inventory min/max rules that would then create a PO in Quickbooks. Quickbooks already does this AND it tracks the rest of your finances with it. 

The same thing happened with support tickets (automatic responses to emails) and phone calls (text back). The software does this already. 

My recommendation, budget willing, is to find an ERP that has MOST of these features. You probably won’t find all of the features in one product. The key here is that MOST of these products are in constant development and it is their goal to be competitive so they focus on making the product intuitive, having features, etc. 

You don’t know what you don’t know. They have access to hundreds of clients that have asked for features and made changes based on feedback.

We weren't hired to write software, we were hired to solve problems, and we use Python as a tool. And as a tool, Python gets me to to the solution faster.  Not because it executes fast, but because you can get working code without a computer science degree and nearly zero boiler plate.  Python was famous at it's launch for being ""executable pseudocode"", and it's largely true.

Let's look at the simplest program; the canonical ""Hello World"" program. In Python:

    print(""Hello World!"")

One line, no obligatory imports or headers, and no extra syntax like semicolons and braces.

The same thing in C would be something like:

    #include <stdio.h>
     
    int main() {
        printf(""Hello World!"");
        return 0;
    }
    
Or in C++:

    #include <iostream>
    
    int main() {
        std::cout << ""Hello World!"";
        return 0;
    }

And having easy integrations with other languages makes Python the obvious choice of scripting language to drive fast code from other languages.

The reason it has become a popular scheme to integrate computationally heavy libraries, like data science, machine learning, or AI, into Python is because the GIL makes it much easier to integrate libraries written in other languages and not produce completely corrupted data every time you call them. Multithreaded programming in a single language is hard, with multiple languages this is even more so; having a GIL though, removes many of the subtleties in multi language, multi threaded interaction, and it makes writing non-native wrappers much simpler than if the language didn't have it. 

Python also has a lot of metaprogramming constructs, like the iterator protocols, metaclasses, descriptor protocol, custom module loaders/import, that makes it quite straightforward to make calling libraries not written in Python not just possible but also look Pythonic and stay relatively performant. This is what makes Python unique because there are not many other languages that allows you to hook into fundamental language constructs the way that Python does.

Take libraries like numpy/pandas, for example, it just wouldn't be possible to port those libraries into languages that doesn't allow you to override the `__getitem__()`, `__setitem__()`, and operators. pydantic (and pydantic-core) would never be possible in languages that doesn't offer descriptor protocol.",False

While I immediately am able to respond to a text message often Voice Notes remain unheard on my phone for hours at a time, until some moment when I have the space, time and ability to listen and respond to them.

With the release of Whisper [https://openai.com/blog/whisper/](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/) which relies on a GPU, I was interested to see what it could do, tldr, it's Amazing!

Second problem, I needed to be able to run it on minimal infrastructure. Telegram has an amazing API with great integrations for python. Using python-telegram-bot I was up and running a new bot in a few minutes, with no need for a web-server, dns, front-ends, nothing that the bot couldn't handle.

Third problem, having it up and running on a lower power PC, enter the superb port to CPU  [https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) and using the lower end models it can run on a Pi 4.

Unfortunately it doesn't have python bindings, which is on the todo list, but simple exec commands could facilitate the running and extracting of text.

I wrote some code for a python Telegram bot, run the processing using an exec command and return the text into python and to the user.

There's a video on YouTube detailing the process [https://youtu.be/MjLzgebcDHo](https://youtu.be/MjLzgebcDHo) as well as a running telegram bot (which if it doesn't get overwhelmed I can leave running indefinitely here [https://web.telegram.org/k/#@shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\_bot](https://web.telegram.org/k/#@shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh_bot)

While the bot is in Telegram, it's actually pretty easy to share voice notes with it from WhatsApp and get a text response.

Note: I'm not claiming this is the *best* way to go about it, or even the *fastest*, it's just how I'd approach it as someone who has worked on a variety of applied ML projects in academia, gov, and at a startup as a research assistant, intern, and senior applied scientist (respectively). One thing I have noticed in the last 6 years or so (the advent of Data Science as a career path for people that really ought to be called Data Analysts) is that when I work with people that know all of this stuff, our projects progress significantly faster vs. when I'm working with people that are missing large portions of this stuff.

1. Fill any gaps in their Computer Science fundamentals (eg; the first few courses of a CS major)
   1. **Data Structures**
   2. **Systems**
      1. Data representation, boolean algebra, system-level I/O, pipelining, and the memory hierarchy
      2. Memory management, concurrent process management, resource management,system call implementation, file systems, and memory protection
   3. **Theory**
      1. Regular languages and finite automata, context free languages and pushdown automata
      2. Turing machines and computability
   4. **Algorithms**
      1. Algorithmic analysis (asymptotic notation, recurrences, loop invariance)
      2. Design techniques such as branch and bound, divide and conquer, dynamic programming
2. which will enable me to teach them **Machine Learning** in this sequence (make them code up one model from each using only Numpy):
   1. **Supervised Learning** with basic models
      1. trees: binary tree, random forest
      2. parametric models: linear regression, logistic regression
      3. probabilistic models: N-Gram, Naive Bayes
   2. **Fundamental Concepts**
      1. Bias Variance tradeoff (over fitting and under fitting)
      2. No free lunch theorem
      3. Curse of Dimensionality
      4. Decision Boundaries
   3. **Unsupervised Learning** with basic models
      1. K-means, hierarchical clustering
   4. **Optimization Algorithms**
      1. genetic algorithms
      2. gradient descent
   5. **Supervised Learning** with Advanced models
      1. neural networks
      2. support vector machines
   6. **Dimensionality Reduction**
      1. PCA
      2. Autoencoders
   7. **Reinforcement Learning** with basic models or just at a high level
3. which should be enough to help them grok **Deep Learning**
   1. **Fundamental architectures**
      1. deep neural network (DNN)
      2. recurrent neural network (RNN)
      3. convolutional neural network (CNN)
   2. **Frameworks**
      1. PyTorch or Tensorflow
      2. make them code up DNN / RNN / CNN using the framework
   3. **Advanced architectures**
      1. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
      2. Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM)
      3. Deep Q Networks (DQN)
      4. Transformers
4. At some point around here I'd have them independently explore one of these **advanced topics** to broaden their perspective a bit
   1. Information theory
   2. Complexity ([this](https://www.amazon.com/Complexity-Guided-Tour-Melanie-Mitchell/dp/0199798109) is a chill read)
   3. Game Theory
5. and also **schedule a weekly reading group** to dissect a high impact Machine Learning paper
6. at this point, I'd feel pretty good about inviting them to collaborate on a novel research / R&D project (they usually spans at least a few quarters) with the end goal being an academic publication, online metric results + technical report / white paper (if it's proprietary), or a patent

&#x200B;

Again; this isn't a complete picture of the topic, but I believe it's enough to start hacking together applications that are truly bleeding edge + while expanding independently into more advanced techniques / topics. If you want to cover every detail I'd recommend finding a thesis-based masters program in Computer Science. Just about every CS professor is researching ML these days and joining one of their labs will put you in an environment where you're coding AI/ML applications in Python alongside a bunch of peers that are also there to learn while simultaneously advancing the field itself.

Deep learning is a ""hot"" area in AI. It can be used to solve many kinds of problems - speech recognition, translation, navigation, image recognition, image/audio/text generation and more!!

I recommend learning to use a Deep learning framework (either Tensorflow or Pytorch or both). Look for a book by Francois Chollet (Tensorflow) or Eli Stevens (Pytorch). Both books walk the reader through multiple hands-on examples with explanations on how it works.

This should get you started. Depending on your goals the step after that will be either understanding more of the mathematics or deployment of models/apps (or both :-))

Originally, I used [Kindle Comic Converter](https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc/), but it's half-broken on Linux half of the time and it was kinda a pain in the ass to manually add the metadata I wanted in Calibre. Seeing ""Unknown Author"" half of the time was a little annoying.

So I looked around before giving up and making my own! Mandown's a slightly overgrown CLI app I've been working on for a few months now to download and convert comics.

It can:

- download comics with multithreading
- apply some of KCC's image processing transformations via Pillow (like trimming borders, resizing, rotating pages)
- and use the downloaded metadata to convert the whole thing into a CBZ, EPUB, or PDF!

To me, it's an all-in-one program that I can just run `mandown get URL --convert epub -p split_double_pages --remove-after` and get the epub with the metadata I want without having to think too hard about it.

I also tried to use all of the new things that people talk about on subreddits, like Poetry, MyPy, Black, etc, which were surprisingly useful! After type hints, I don't think I can go back ~~(although sometimes the whole type system feels like a fragile hack)~~

2017,Does anyone else constantly have problems with Conda conflicts?,sext-scientist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/105qinj/does_anyone_else_constantly_have_problems_with/,105qinj,"Conda is a cool Python environment manager, but it also has some very opinionated ideas about what a valid environment is.

One issue I run into a lot is if you install a newer package on PIP, which works fine mind you. This usually causes a conflict like your current env requiring libgen 3.27, but the package you downloaded using 3.29 for example. At this point your whole conda is nuked and there’s no way to patch the conflict except try to roll back. You can’t just tell conda to mind it’s own business and ignore conflicts because it will never be able to resolve your environment ever again which is the first step of asking conda to do anything.

3 is the case when you the package has a system lib, so, dll dependency, but that reason should be the only reason you touch ""conda install"".


Why? Because pip install is saying to conda: ""don't run dependency management on this module"" ---even when you are pip installing into the python installed by conda. Conda install is saying to conda ""run dependency management on this module..."" You usually don't want or need that.

Python is great at a lot of things, but this isn’t one of them. IMO one of the reasons Python gets some (arguable deserved) flack is because people try to use it for everything, then wonder why using Python for game development was a bad idea. Being a good programmer is not about knowing how to use a couple tools for any job, but knowing what jobs are right for the tools you have. I know that was a bit of negativity so let’s talk about what j would recommend instead. First, yes you can use Python for this project, but I wouldn’t recommend it for the whole thing. If you have a need for a backend (database management, large scale data processing, etc) use Python for that 100%. I recommend flask as it’s pretty easy to setup a REST API with. For the actual app itself, I don’t have much experience personally, but somethings I have used were react native and flutter and you mentioned above. Flutter is a really cool technology but it uses a completely different language called dart. Dart is fine, absolutely no complaints about the language itself, but it’s a bit smaller since it’s only use is pretty much just flutter. This could make it ever so slightly to find support but it’s not that bad. I haven’t noticed much of a problem w it. React I have less experience with but still a good experience. Support is a bit better and experience is about equal I’d say. Although, morally, I don’t like it simply bc I have my own problems w Meta, but there’s not much wrong w the product itself. It has a bit of an advantage over flutter simply bc it’s in JS which means you can use TypeScript which has recently become one of my favorite languages. One more thing to add to this list that I’ve had my eye on but haven’t gotten to try yet is [svelte-native](https://svelte-native.technology).
